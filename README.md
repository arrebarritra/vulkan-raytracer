# Vulkan raytracer
This is my work in progress Vulkan raytracer, which makes use Vulkans hardware ray tracing features.

# Building
1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch external dependencies (GLFW and GLM)
2. Run `cmake source-directory` to build project

Vulkan SDK and GLSLC are required dependencies.
